## General Info
![How the game page looks like!](/angel.png "Game page")
This game was created based on a friends memory of a game he played as a teenager.
This project is developed in my spare time. I'm using testdata when developing so
depending on whether I remembered to change back to sharp data, the UseMockData
method in PlayerViewModel can be changed to false to run the program sharply

## Technologies
The project is created with:
* .NET Core version: 3.1
* C# version: 8.0
* MVVM
* Interface
* Drag-and-drop

## License
No Licence.
